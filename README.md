# Postman

My personal Postman sandbox workspace that used to deal with APIs for my development, in an organised, neat way.

## Repository

In this repository, the Postman collections will reside in the `collections` folder. The subfolder `dev` is the folder that contains the collections for my personal projects. On the other hand, the `third-party` folder will include the API endpoints to external API supplier that I am **consuming** within my project.

The `environments` folder will contain all the essential environments for development such as development, staging and production. For non-development works, another environment will be used.

## Postman Screenshots

The following are the screenshots of my Postman client that demonstrates the application of the good practises that makes the whole workspace clean and delightful to work with.
