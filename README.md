# Postman

My personal Postman sandbox workspace that used to deal with APIs for my development, in an organised, neat way.

## Repository

In this repository, the Postman collections will reside in the `collections` folder. The subfolder `dev` is the folder that contains the collections for my personal projects. On the other hand, the `third-party` folder will include the API endpoints to external API supplier that I am **consuming** within my project.

The `environments` folder will contain all the essential environments for development such as development, staging and production. For non-development works, another environment will be used.

## Postman Screenshots

The following are the screenshots of my Postman client that demonstrates the application of the good practises that makes the whole workspace clean and delightful to work with.

The environments are configured properly as shown.
